# x402 Endpoint

**6 directories. 1 catalog.**

**Live product:** https://endpoint.x402jp.com/

This repository is the source for x402 Endpoint's public catalog, REST API,
and MCP server. The catalog is refreshed by the scheduled workflow; see the
`last_seen` field on individual records for each endpoint's observed freshness.

A cross-directory unified catalog of x402 ecosystem endpoints. The x402
ecosystem has several community-maintained directories running in parallel;
this is a static site that aggregates them into a single browsable catalog so
you don't have to check each one individually.

Aggregated directories:

| Source | Site | Fetcher |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x402 Inc. (self-curated) | https://x402jp.com | ✅ seed (`data/seed/x402-inc.json`) |
| x402scan (Merit Systems) | https://x402scan.com | ✅ implemented |
| Onyx Bazaar (CDP discovery) | https://onyx-actions.onrender.com/bazaar | ✅ implemented |
| Pay.sh (Solana) | https://pay.sh | ✅ implemented (pay-skills catalog) |
| Agentic.Market (Base) | https://agentic.market | stub (dynamic; data via CDP Bazaar) |
| Ampersend | https://app.ampersend.ai/discover | stub (no public API) |
| Visa CLI Merchant Registry | https://app.visacli.sh/merchants | stub (invite-only) |
| Circle Agent Marketplace | https://agents.circle.com | stub (dynamic) |

## Stack

- **Next.js 15** (App Router) + **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Fuse.js** for client-side search
- Deployed on **Vercel**

## Architecture

Static site + daily batch fetch:

1. **`scripts/fetch-directories.ts`** runs each per-directory fetcher, dedupes
   by canonical URL, merges cross-directory duplicates, and writes **two**
   files (see [Two catalog files](#two-catalog-files)):
   **`data/endpoints_full.json.gz`** (everything) and **`data/endpoints.json`**
   (the capped subset the site bundles). Every run records a per-source
   `fetch_report` (see [Fetch coverage](#fetch-coverage-and-the-2026-09-22-break)).
2. **Next.js pages** read `data/endpoints.json` in server components and render
   it. Pages use ISR (`revalidate = 86400`) so they refresh at most once a day.
3. **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/daily-fetch.yml`) runs the fetch on a
   daily cron, commits the updated JSON, and pushes — Vercel redeploys on push.

## Two catalog files

The fetch writes both of these on every run:

| file | holds | who reads it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data/endpoints_full.json.gz` | **every** endpoint, gzipped | `scripts/write-stats-snapshot.mjs`; anyone asking how big x402 actually is. **Nothing under `src/` imports it.** |
| `data/endpoints.json` | a subset, at most `subset_limit` (20,000) | `src/lib/data.ts` — the site, its pages and its REST API |

They exist separately because of how the site is built. `src/lib/data.ts`
imports `data/endpoints.json` **at build time** and `src/app/page.tsx` passes
the result to `<CatalogExplorer>`, a client component — so every endpoint in
that file is serialized into the page payload. ~19k endpoints (~490 bytes
each) is the proven-safe figure against Vercel's ~19 MB ISR limit, and that is
what the x402scan fetcher's old `MAX_ENDPOINTS = 20000` was really protecting.
Removing the fetch cap without splitting the files would have broken the build.

The subset is `every non-x402scan endpoint, then the most recently updated
x402scan ones (last_seen desc) up to the limit` — the old behaviour was
"the first 20,000 x402scan rows by lastUpdated desc", so the freshest 20,000
keeps the deployed page equivalent. The other directories are always kept
(there are under a hundred, and the x402-inc seed is featured in the UI), and
selection runs after the cross-source merge so a URL several directories list
is never dropped as "just x402scan".

`data/endpoints.json` marks itself: `subset_of`, `subset_limit`, `subset_rule`
and `full_count` are all present, so its `count` can never be mistaken for an
ecosystem total. `write-stats-snapshot.mjs` refuses to count a file carrying
`subset_of`.

**Why the full file is gzipped.** It is committed on every daily run, and at
~66 MB of pretty-printed JSON a day that would outgrow the repository within
months. `gzip -9` takes it to ~5 MB (~7%) in a fraction of a second, and Node
zeroes the gzip header's mtime, so identical data still compresses to identical
bytes and an unchanged catalog produces no diff. Read it with
`scripts/read-catalog.mjs` (or `gunzip -c data/endpoints_full.json.gz | jq .`);
an uncompressed `data/endpoints_full.json` is still accepted if present, so a
checkout from before the change keeps working.

**Two consequences to know about.** `data/stats/*.json` is computed from the
full file while the site shows the subset, so the site's own counter and the
snapshots will disagree — the snapshots are the true ones. And the REST API
under `src/app/api/` reads the same bundled subset, so it serves the subset
too; making it serve all of x402 means reading the full file at request time
(or a database), which is a front-end/runtime change and is deliberately not
done here.

To raise the cap, move the homepage's search to `/api/search` and paginate the
list server-side, then change `PAGE_SUBSET_MAX` in `scripts/page-subset.ts`.

## Unified data format

See `src/lib/types.ts`. Each entry:

```ts
type Endpoint = {
  id: string;            // stable hash of the canonical URL
  url: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  category: "data" | "compute" | "search" | "media" | "trading" | "messaging" | "other";
  price?: { amount: number; currency: string; unit: string };
  networks: string[];    // Base, Solana, Polygon, ...
  protocols: string[];   // x402, MPP, L402
  source: DirectorySource[]; // every directory the URL was seen in
  source_url: string;
  last_seen: string;     // ISO 8601
};
```

When the same URL appears in multiple directories the records are merged and
`source` holds every directory it was seen in.

## Fetch coverage, and the 2026-09-22 break

**Runs from 2026-09-22 onward fetch x402scan in full. Earlier runs did not.**

Until 2026-09-22 the x402scan fetcher stopped after 20,000 rows (a
`MAX_ENDPOINTS` constant in `scripts/fetchers/x402scan.ts`). Every healthy run
from 2026-08-07 on therefore reported exactly 20,000 for that source — the
number was the cap, not the directory. x402scan's API has no such limit
(`paginatedQuerySchema` puts no upper bound on `page_size`, and the query is a
plain Prisma `skip`/`take`), so the fetcher now pages until the list is
exhausted.

**Do not compare totals across that boundary without saying so.** The catalog
count and everything derived from it — `data/stats/*.json`, host counts,
category and price-tier splits — change scale on that date because coverage
changed, not because the ecosystem did. The daily snapshots on either side are
each internally consistent; a trend line that crosses 2026-09-22 is not.

Each run records its own coverage in `fetch_report`, so a short catalog can
never look like a healthy one:

| field | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `rows` | rows the upstream API actually served (x402scan keys rows by URL + method, so one URL can appear more than once) |
| `count` | endpoints the fetcher returned |
| `unique_after_dedup` | distinct canonical URLs in those, before the cross-source merge |
| `pages` | requests made |
| `api_total` | the upstream's own `total_count`, when it reports one |
| `truncated` | **true when the run did not reach the end of the list** — a safety limit, a depth ceiling, or a page that kept failing |
| `stopped_reason` | `exhausted` (complete), `safety_limit`, `page_ceiling`, or `page_error` |
| `slices` | per-pass counts when one pass wasn't enough |

The fetcher pages `lastUpdated desc` with a ≥1s gap between requests, retries
429/5xx with exponential backoff (honouring `Retry-After`), and stops at a
200,000-row safety limit that reports `truncated: true` rather than quietly
returning a short catalog. If the API ever does impose a depth ceiling, the
run re-reads the list in the other sort orders and unions by canonical URL,
recording each slice. Knobs: `X402SCAN_PAGE_SIZE`, `X402SCAN_GAP_MS`,
`X402SCAN_SAFETY_MAX`.

`.github/workflows/verify-fetch.yml` runs the live fetchers and diffs the
result against the committed catalog **without committing or deploying**, for
checking a fetcher change before the daily job pushes it.

## Agent access (API + MCP)

The catalog is readable programmatically — no auth, CORS-open, edge-cached.

REST API (`src/app/api/`):

| Route | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/endpoints` | All endpoints; filter by `category`, `network`, `protocol`, `source` |
| `GET /api/endpoints/:id` | A single endpoint |
| `GET /api/search?q=` | Fuzzy search (Fuse.js) |
| `GET /api/stats` | Aggregate counts |
| `GET /api/openapi.json` | OpenAPI 3.1 spec |

A light, best-effort per-IP rate limit lives in `src/middleware.ts` (in-memory,
no external store; returns `429` + `Retry-After` past the window). See
[`For Agents`](https://endpoint.x402jp.com/#for-agents) for usage.

MCP server: the [`mcp/`](./mcp) package (`x402-endpoint-mcp`) exposes
`list_endpoints`, `search_endpoints`, `get_endpoint`, and `get_stats`, backed by
the REST API. See [`mcp/README.md`](./mcp/README.md) for client setup.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
npm run fetch        # run the directory fetchers and rebuild data/endpoints.json
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

`data/endpoints.json` ships with sample data so the site renders before any
fetcher is implemented. The fetchers are currently stubs (`return []`) — the
orchestrator leaves the existing JSON untouched when nothing is fetched, so the
sample data survives until real fetchers land.

## Implementing a fetcher

Each fetcher exports an `async` function returning `Promise<Endpoint[]>` and
maps a directory's listings into the unified shape. When implementing:

- **Prefer a public API.** x402scan, Agentic.Market, and Circle are likely to
  offer APIs (GraphQL or REST) — use those over HTML scraping.
- **Respect `robots.txt` and terms of service.** Don't scrape where it's
  disallowed. The Visa CLI Merchant Registry is invite-only; confirm the
  merchant list may be republished before enabling that fetcher.
- **Be polite.** Keep at least 1 second between requests (`sleep` in
  `scripts/util.ts`).
- **Fail soft.** Throwing from a fetcher only skips that directory; the rest
  still run.
- For directories that can't be fetched automatically, maintaining a manual
  JSON is an acceptable fallback.

## x402 Inc. endpoints (seed source)

This catalog is built by [x402 Inc.](https://x402jp.com), which also ships its
own x402 endpoints. Those are included here as a **seed source**
(`source: ["x402-inc"]`), maintained by hand in `data/seed/x402-inc.json` and
loaded by the `x402-inc` fetcher (`scripts/fetchers/x402-inc.ts`). Modeling
them as a fetcher means they flow through the same dedupe/merge as every other
directory — if x402scan or Onyx Bazaar also list one of these URLs, the entry's
`source` becomes e.g. `["x402-inc", "onyx-bazaar"]`.

### Featuring & disclosure

x402 Inc. operates this catalog and **features its own endpoints**:

- They are styled in gold and pinned to the top of listings
  (`src/lib/featured.ts` + `EndpointCard`). This is openly disclosed on the
  About page rather than hidden.
- The **third-party directories are aggregated on equal footing** with no
  preferential ranking between them.
- x402 Inc. endpoints are still listed under their own `x402-inc` source and
  remain subject to dedupe; a URL also found in a third-party directory shows
  both sources.

## Contributing

No sign-up, submission form, or dynamic features. To add or correct an
endpoint, open a pull request — everything is PR-based.

## Deployment

Connect the repo to Vercel with **Production Branch = `main`**. The daily GitHub
Actions job (`.github/workflows/daily-fetch.yml`) fetches, writes a stats
snapshot, and commits `data/endpoints.json`, `data/endpoints_full.json.gz` and
`data/stats/` to `main`.

Because the site imports `data/endpoints.json` **at build time**, the front only
updates on a fresh deploy — ISR revalidation alone won't change the numbers. To
guarantee a rebuild on each daily commit, the workflow can call a **Vercel
Deploy Hook**:

1. Vercel → Project → Settings → Git → **Deploy Hooks** → create one for `main`.
2. GitHub → repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → add
   `VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK` = the hook URL.

When set, the cron POSTs the hook after pushing (only when data changed). If the
secret is absent, it falls back to Vercel's Git auto-deploy — so make sure that
is enabled and pointed at `main` if you don't use the hook.
